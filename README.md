BEE Manipulator is a "manager" for BEE2.4 and Portal 2, with BM (short for BEE Manipulator) you can browse user-created packages
that are on the UCPDatabase, a database for all user created packages, you can submit one too!


with BM you can also modify the BEE2.4 splash screen and some aspects of Portal 2 with BEE Manipulator Packages or install P2 mods.
